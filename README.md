# Workday-Scheduler Challenge 5

This is a daily planner also known as a workday scheduler. When you open the planner the current date is seen on top of the calendar. When
you scroll down then your presented with time blocks for standard business hours. Each block is also colour coded to indicate when it's in the past,
present or future. When the time is clicked on you can enter an event. There's also a save button that has been implemented so users can save their events. Finally once the page is refreshed the saved events still exist.
